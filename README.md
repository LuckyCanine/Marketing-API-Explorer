Marketing API Explorer
======================

Experiment with Facebook Marketing API interactively

This small Facebook app allows you to experiment with Facebook Ads API. It is similar to using Graph API Explorer (https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer), but it is customized for ad API calls.

This app works on Chrome browser (or other HTML5 browsers). Also, this app doesn't store any of your data in its backend. It uses HTML5 client-side technology (JavaScript) to keep everything cached on your browser.
